Method Referencing
------------------

Method referencing is the process of assigning a method to a functional interface.


@FunctionalInterface
interface Maths{
	public int add(int a, int b);
	
}

Maths m = (a,b)->a+b;

class Mathematics{
		public static int addition(int x , int y){
		//statements;	
		return x+y;
		}
}
Mathematics m1 = new Mathematics();




Maths m = m1::addition;
Maths m = Mathematics::addition;


m.add(20,30);


Exception Handling
------------------
1. Compile time errors  --- Wrong syntax of the programming language
2. Runtime errors  --- Due to many reasons, cannot be predicted.

Exception is an runtime error.

The process of handling the runtime errors.

eg> FileNotFound, IOException, 

int c=a/b;  // exception, when b=0
sysout(c);

b=0, then it becomes an exception

Str = "Hello";
str.charAt(8); // exception

s1;
s2;
s3;--> if there is an exception, then lang, absrtuply terminates the execution and throws one exception object

s4;
s5;

The goal of exception handling in java, is to make sure that our program continues even after the
exception is raised.



try{

	opened a database;
	// keep all the eroor prone code

	

}

catch(ExceptionObject-1 )
{




}
catch(ExceptionObject-2 )
{



}

finally{
closing of database
// keep the code to be mandatorily executed

}
next_statements;


1. When there is no exception

try ---> finally ---> next_statments(program will continue)

2. When there is an exception and corresponding catach block is avaiable
try ---> catch ---> finally --> next_statment

3. When there is an exception and coresponding catch block is not available

try--> finally --> stops the execution



Points to remember
-------------------
1. when we have multiple catch blocks, parent catch block should not come before child catch block.


2. Never user exception in catch block.


3. We should never write single try block for the complete program,
   we should use multiple try catch blocks, so as to handle all the exceptions at a time.
